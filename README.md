# odin-recipes

I took on this recipe project as my first review or refresher since I
hadn't coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for three months after
initially learning them.

I'm relieved to see that I haven't forgotten everything about the basic
HTML and CSS yet. Even though it's simple, I'm satisfied with this
project as it serves its purpose of reviewing my current skills.
