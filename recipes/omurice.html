            Omurice or omu-rice (オムライス, Omu-raisu) is a Japanese dish
            consisting of an omelette made with fried rice and thin, fried
            scrambled eggs, usually topped with ketchup.

         <h3>Preparations</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>
               Make the rice: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add 1
               tablespoon butter, and then onion and carrot. Cook, stirring,
               until onion is translucent and a little browned at the edges,
               about 3 minutes. Add ham and cook, stirring, until it begins to
               brown, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
               Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and then rice, breaking it up
               with a wooden spoon or long chopsticks. Adjust heat to medium and
               cook until the grains are glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in ketchup
               and soy sauce, and cook, stirring, another 30 seconds or so to
               caramelize. Stir in peas to heat through, and deglaze the pan
               with dashi or chicken stock. Remove from heat and season to taste
               with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
               To make a perfect mound of rice on each plate, grease a small
               bowl with canola or safflower oil and pack 1 cup of the rice.
               Invert this over a plate and remove the bowl. Repeat with the
               other half of the rice on a second plate.
            </li>
            <li>
               Make the omelet: In a small (6- or 7-inch) nonstick skillet (or a
               well-seasoned carbon steel omelet pan), heat ½ teaspoon oil, or
               just enough to coat the pan, over medium-high. Beat 2 eggs with ½
               teaspoon dashi or water, until yolks and whites are completely
               blended. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
               Pour the egg mixture into the heated pan. Shake and swirl the pan
               over the heat, stirring constantly with chopsticks or a fork as
               the eggs cook. When lots of small curds have formed and the eggs
               are custardy, about 30 seconds, let cook undisturbed until nearly
               set, about 30 seconds. Run a butter knife or small spatula around
               the edge of the omelet, and tap the pan firmly against the stove
               to release the omelet. Turn the omelet out onto the rice,
               custardy side down. Use a clean dish towel or paper towel to push
               the edges under the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
               Repeat with the other 2 eggs for the second omelet. Dress the
               omelets with a zigzag of ketchup (or a cute design if you’ve got
               a steady hand), and serve.
